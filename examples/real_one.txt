The crisis is now entering its second week. It started when BP (BP) was forced to temporarily close some of its service stations earlier in September for the second time in as many months because of a shortage of tanker drivers made worse by the pandemic and Brexit.
The closure of stations triggered a spate of panic buying by British motorists, exhausting supplies almost as quickly as they were replenished. The British Medical Association warned last week that healthcare workers, including ambulance drivers, won't be able to do their jobs as pumps run dry.
The situation has since improved in some parts of the country but remains "challenging" in London and the south east of the country, where many filling stations are dry, according to the Petrol Retailers Association.
